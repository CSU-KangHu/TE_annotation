# TE annotation libraries used in the benchmarking of HiTE
The TE libraries generated by HiTE, RepeatModeler2, EDTA, and RepeatScout are located in the directories HiTE_lib, rm2_lib, EDTA_lib, and RS_lib, respectively.

# Novel TIR elements detected by HiTE
HiTE discovers over 800 novel TIR elements with well-defined structures that are not included in known libraries.

You can find the multiple sequence alignment files for each of the novel TIR elements in the **msa.tar.gz** file, and the structural definitions for each transposon in the **data.xlsx** file, both of which are located in the **novel_tir_rice** directory.

With these information, we can easily determine the structural features of novel TIR elements and validate their reliability. The following figure shows the novel TIR transposons identified by HiTE, visualized using MEGA.
